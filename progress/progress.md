## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Manual Flight Control

**Objective:**  
Enable stable manual flight using an RC transmitter and basic drone hardware.

**Status:**  
‚úÖ Completed

**Details:**
- Multiple successful test flights conducted.
- System includes calibrated ESCs, correctly oriented propellers, and Pixhawk-based flight control.

**Highlight:**  
The team was invited to showcase the drone at the 1 Air Squadron NCC Drone Training Camp in Kullu, recognizing the success of this phase.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Phase 2: Autonomous GPS Waypoint Navigation

**Objective:**  
Enable autonomous flight using Mission Planner, GPS module, and waypoints.

**Status:**  
‚ö†Ô∏è In Progress

**Progress:**
- Initial setup completed.
- One failed test flight due to missing components (e.g., telemetry module, GPS fine-tuning).

**Next Steps:**
- Install and configure GPS + telemetry module.
- Plan and upload waypoints in Mission Planner.
- Conduct real-time autonomous flight tests.

## ‚õî Phase 3: Obstacle Avoidance

**Objective:**  
Implement real-time object detection and avoidance using sensors.

**Status:**  
‚ùå Not Started

**Planned Features:**
- Integrate ultrasonic or LiDAR sensors.
- Add onboard processing for obstacle detection (e.g., Arduino/Raspberry Pi or companion computer).
- Program logic to avoid obstacles in autonomous mode.
